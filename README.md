## Final Note: Collaborate with AI Wisely

While GitHub Copilot is a powerful tool that can significantly boost your productivity, it is important to remember that AI-generated suggestions should always be reviewed and verified. Use Copilot as a collaborative partner, and ensure that you:

- **Carefully review** any code or recommendations provided.
- **Cross-check** AI-generated outputs against your project requirements.
- **Maintain a healthy skepticism** and don't rely solely on the AI's suggestions.
- **Collaborate** with the tool by integrating its input with your own expertise to produce the best results.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively work with GitHub Copilot while ensuring the quality and integrity of your code.
